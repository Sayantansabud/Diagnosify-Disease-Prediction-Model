Building a Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App with Flask and Machine Learning
In the age of technology and information, access to accurate and timely healthcare is more critical than ever. With the increasing importance of remote healthcare solutions, I developed a symptom-based disease diagnosis web application using Flask and machine learning. This user-friendly platform helps users identify potential illnesses based on their symptoms.

### The Problem
Many individuals experience symptoms and seek immediate health insights. However, due to overlapping symptoms across diseases, it becomes difficult to determine the actual illness. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering an accessible solution.

### The Solution
Our web app enables users to input symptoms and get a prediction of potential diseases using a pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier model. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Symptom Input: Users input their symptoms via a clean and easy interface.
Machine Learning Model: A Decision Tree Classifier predicts the likely disease from a trained dataset.
Prediction: Instant display of the most likely disease based on input.
Additional Information: Includes disease description, precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.
### Key Features
User-Friendly Interface: Simple symptom entry process for all users.
Accurate Predictions: ML-backed predictions based on real health data.
Comprehensive Info: Disease summary, medications, precautions, diet, and workouts included.
Educational Blog: Health-related blog posts to boost awareness and well-being.
### Conclusion
This AI-powered platform makes healthcare information more accessible, empowering users to take proactive steps toward well-being. In a time where remote health services are rising, this tool helps users get instant insights and enhances awareness around personal health conditions.
